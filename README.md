Hello! This is my third TOP project in the curriculum thus far! Today, I will be making a simple rock paper scissors game that can be played from the console. I will be using as much as I have learned about Javascript so far in this project, as well as some additional information as well (functions, variables, loops, conditionals, etc). With that being said, I hope you enjoy the project, thanks for stopping by!
